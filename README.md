# MPMS (MultiPlayer MineSweeper)

Here's a list of things I plan on implementing:
* A turn based system for playing with the AI
* Ability for the AI to realize when a bad flag is placed (it never places bad flags unless its guessing)
* A help button for if you want to play single player
* 100% Concurrency-safe code

And here's what I have completed:
* A Fully fledged Minesweeeper game using a console UI
* The same game with a Swing UI
* An AI player that's somewhat smart
