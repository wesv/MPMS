Essentially Multiplayer Minesweeper (MP MS)

Here's a list of things I plan on implementing:
* The same game with a [Processing UI](https://processing.org/)
* A Server-Client model for running a single-player game
* Modifications to the above model to allow for multiple people play the same game
* An AI partner for multiplayear using some sort of neural network
* An Android UI
* A website UI

And here's what I have completed:
* A Fully fledged Minesweeeper game using a console UI
